## Implemented Features

### Multi-user / login
- Django built-in auth with `LOGIN_URL='/login/'`, `LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL='/tournaments/'`, `LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL='/login/'`
- All views require `@login_required`
- `Tournament` and `Player` have `owner = FK → AUTH_USER_MODEL`
- All querysets filter on `owner=request.user` — data is completely isolated between users
- The nav bar shows the username + Logout button; the Admin link is only visible for `is_staff`
- Danish login form with error message

### Players and pairs
- Create / edit / delete players with name, age, ranking, division, and gender
- Create / edit / delete pairs (singles auto-created via division registration; doubles / mixed created manually)
- `TeamForm.clean()` validates: doubles = same gender, mixed = opposite gender
- Player status: `player_status.py` + `get_busy_info()` calculate who is playing or resting
- **Rest period:** `Player.rest_until` is set automatically after a match. It can be reset manually via the `✕ Rest` button on the player list
- Status badges (🏸 playing, ⏱ resting with countdown) are shown on the schedule and big screen

### Tournaments and divisions
- Create / edit tournaments: name, date, scoring model, court count, singles / doubles duration, break time
- Divisions per tournament with discipline (`single` / `double` / `mixed`) and type (`group` / `playoff` / `tree`)
- Seeding: teams can be assigned seed numbers per division (`DivisionSeed`)
- Programme lock: `schedule_locked` prevents changes to the match programme and time schedule

### Match-programme generation (`scheduler.py`)
See [program_generation.md](program_generation.md) for full documentation.

| Type | Method | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `group` | `generate_round_robin` | Circle method: n-1 rounds × n/2 simultaneous matches |
| `tree` | `generate_bracket` | Single elimination with seeding, byes, and bracket placeholders |
| `playoff` | `generate_playoff` | Group stage (circle method) + playoff bracket |

The circle method ensures that all matches in the same round can be scheduled simultaneously (maximum court utilisation).  
Snake seeding in playoffs distributes teams evenly across groups.

### Time-schedule generation (`schedule_planner.py`)
See [program_generation.md](program_generation.md) for full documentation.

**OR-Tools CP-SAT solver** (primary): Finds the **optimal** solution (shortest tournament duration) by solving a constraint satisfaction problem. Around 30 matches are solved in milliseconds.

**Greedy fallback**: Used if OR-Tools fails. Processes matches one at a time and chooses the earliest available court, with a tie-break in favour of the busiest court.

Both methods respect:
- Court capacity (max 1 match per court at a time)
- Player conflict (a player cannot play two matches simultaneously)
- Break time (minimum `player_break_time` minutes between a player's matches)
- Playoff barrier (playoff matches after all group matches in the division)
- Bracket order (placeholders only after both feeder matches)

### BWF score validation
`MatchResultForm` validates submitted results against BWF rules:
- Format: `"21-15, 18-21, 21-18"` (2 or 3 sets separated by commas)
- Set rules: minimum 21 points to win, deuce at 20-20 (must win by 2), maximum 30-29
- A third set is required only at 1-1 in sets
- The winner field is checked against the set count
- Danish-language validation errors

### Backup / export-import
- `tournament_export`: Downloads a full tournament (players, teams, divisions, matches, seeds) as JSON
- `tournament_import`: Recreates a tournament from a JSON backup — deduplicates players and teams via `get_or_create`
- Export format version 1; an error is shown for unknown versions

### Divisions - extra field
- `Division.schedule_priority` (IntegerField 1-10, default 5): Controls weighting in the OR-Tools optimisation
- Can be set per division via the `division_set_priority` view

### Teams - extra field
- `Team.division` (CharField, optional): Indicates which division the pair plays in (U9-C)

### Public views (no login)
- `/public/` – landing page: choose club and tournament
- `/public/tournament/<pk>/` – standings and match results for a tournament
- `/public/tournament/<pk>/spilleplan/` – read-only schedule with status badges

### UI features
- **Schedule spinner**: Loading overlay with rotating ring during OR-Tools calculation
- **Court numbers**: Not shown in the UI (removed from all templates) but still used internally by scheduling
- **Big-screen view** (`/tournaments/<pk>/bigscreen/`): Shows the next 5 matches with status badges and live rest countdown (JS)
- **Printouts**: Match programme (print-friendly, per division), score sheets (one page per match), player programme (per player without courts)
- **Score sheet**: The oval for the winner name has been removed; the umpire marks it manually
- **Menu item**: The nav bar uses `Pairs` (previously `Teams`)

## Known Limitations and Possible Next Steps

- **Re-scheduling after results**: When a bracket placeholder advances (`team1/team2` becomes known), `scheduled_time` is not updated automatically. The user must regenerate the schedule manually.
- **Placeholder times are estimates**: Playoff matches are scheduled based on planned, not actual, end times of feeder matches.
- **Mixed-doubles duration**: Uses `double_match_duration` as the fallback — there is no separate field for mixed.
- **PDF export**: Printouts are handled through browser print; there is no PDF generation.
- **Matches app**: Exists in the project but is empty and unused (can be deleted).
- **`_debug_schedule.py`**: Helper script in the root folder for debugging — should be removed before production.
- **Docker / production**: The plan is documented in [dockerplan.md](dockerplan.md) — awaiting access to Docker.
